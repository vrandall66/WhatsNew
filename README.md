# What's New?

What's New is a news app I built utilizing `npx create-react-app`

## Languages and Tech Used

- React
- Jest and Enzyme
- Webpack

## Summary

This was my first serious dive into the React framework utilizing the Jest and Enzyme testing suite. My personal learning goals for this project were to have a practice testing with Snapshots, event listeners, changes in state, while also focusing on how best to utilize properties, and breaking down an application into functional and class based components.
